# XL Release ServiceNow Integration

## Preface

This document describes the xlr-servicenow-plugin implementation.

See the *XL Release Reference Manual* for background information on XL Release and release concepts.

## Overview

This plugin is primarily aimed to support ServiceNow ITSM and agile development. To use the plugin we need to add it to the plugins directory of xl-release.

Once this plugin is added to xl-release, task specific to ServiceNow is available.
